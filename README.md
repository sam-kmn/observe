# Observe

Dynamic charts based on data entered in table.\
You can manipulate charts by switching visibility of columns,\
and restricting the timeline.\
Timeline pagination is dynamicly created based on length of dataset. (component is only available if table has atleast 5 entries)

There is no need to register, thanks to data stored in local storage. Disadvantage of this is that data can't be shared across other devices.
