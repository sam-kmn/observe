# Observe

Dynamic charts based on data entered in table.\
You can manipulate charts by switching visibility of columns.
<!-- and restricting the timeline.\
Timeline pagination is dynamicly created based on length of dataset.\
(component is only available if table has atleast 5 entries) -->

Data stored in local storage, thus there is no need to register.\
Disadvantage of this is that data can't be shared across other devices.
